# Antalya Diplomacy Forum - Participants' Country of Origin

The Antalya Diplomacy Forum (ADF) has become an elevated occasion for senior-level foreign policy experts and officials to meet and discuss contemporary issues in international relations. To this end, this repository contains the code for the map visualizing the geographical distribution of attendees for the 2022 meeting. Please kindly note that although basic web scraping was being used to determine each participant's country of origin through [this website](https://antalyadf.org/en/participants-2022/), an extra data gathering process was conducted manually through Google search as not all participants' countries of origin could be found. However, you can find and check out the final dataset in this repository being used for the map.
